# AirportProject
An Assignment of my cpp class

**Question discription:**
Assuming that you are going to disign a traffic control system for a small airport with **only one** runway.
Try to build a CPP project to realize these functions:

* Simulate the running process of the airport
* Count the total waiting time of landing queue and departing queue
* The runway has been empty for how long until the airport is shut down?

**You should notice that:**

* The runway can only process **one** plane(either landing or departing) in a time unit
* The probability of plane asking for landing/departing is a const(probability of landing and departing may differ from each other)
* The possible number of planes require to land and depart should be less than one in total, or the small airport may be over-crowded
* It is allowed that a number of planes are waiting to land or depart

**Instructions:**

* Use class to solve these problems
* Use possion distribution to simulate number of planes ask to land/depart in a time unit
* Some functions of the project have been given, including the main function
